Hello, my name is **Ting-Hsuan Chen**. I am currently working as an [optical coating R&D scientist at Gentex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ting-hsuanchen/) for dimmable devices and components. Before that, I received an MS and a PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Materials Science from Duke University. I always feel excited and think most frequently about trends, developments, and businesses in the tech industry that will shape our future life. 

While being a bit disorganized by nature, I somehow oddly appreciate the things in order. 

As of ***September 2025***, I recently spend most of my time:

- Researching optical engineering, AR/VR technologies, and looking for cool ideas and stories in them
- Exploring Michigan (and Midwest US) on weekends
- Enjoying my mechanical keyboards and learning to type faster on them!
- Reading about spirituality and religion

The idea of sharing what I'm up to now is inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).
